This repository contains a K-Means clustering model for fraud detection in financial accounts. The Python code preprocesses account-level data, selects key financial features, and applies unsupervised learning to group accounts based on suspicious behavior patterns. The script includes data normalization, optimal cluster selection using the Elbow Method, and cluster interpretation to identify potential fraud. The analysis helps detect anomalies such as high transaction volumes, rapid fund movements, and unusual geographic activity, supporting anti-money laundering (AML) investigations.
